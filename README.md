# Data analysis: Microplastic and organic carbon storage in sediments of intertidal and subtidal seagrass meadows     

# Overview

This repository contains the scripts used for the data analysis presented in the scientific article titled "Microplastic and organic carbon storage in sediments of intertidal and subtidal seagrass meadows" (not published yet). The article investigated the capacity of intertidal and subtidal seagrasses in capturing microplastics and store organic carbon in the sediments.
