# Data analysis: Microplastic and organic carbon storage in sediments of intertidal and subtidal seagrass meadows     

# Overview

This repository contains the script used for the data analysis presented in the scientific article titled "Microplastic and organic carbon storage in sediments of intertidal and subtidal seagrass meadows" (not published yet). The article investigated the capacity of intertidal and subtidal seagrasses in capturing microplastics and store organic carbon in the sediments.    

# Contents

* README.md: This file, containing information about the repository and how to use it.    
* full_script.R: Script for the data analysis and visualisation.       

# Requirements

To replicate the analysis, you will need the following software:

R Core Team (2023). _R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing_. R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
  Vienna, Austria. <https://www.R-project.org/>.
  
Posit team (2023). RStudio: Integrated Development Environment for R. Posit Software, PBC, Boston, MA. URL
  http://www.posit.co/.

To install the necessary packages, see the commands included in the script.    

# Usage

To run the analysis:

1. Download data files from Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.12793395): data_cores.csv, data_samples.csv, data_particles_ftir.csv, data_particles_visual.csv.
2. Place the data files in a data/raw/ directory.    
3. Create a data/processed directory.   
4. Create a results/ directory contaning two directories: results/figures/ and results/tables/. 
5. Run the script in the scripts/ directory.  
6. Generated results will be saved in the results/ directories.
